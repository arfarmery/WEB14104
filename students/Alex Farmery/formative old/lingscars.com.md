# Lingscars.com 

In the beginning i was trying to establish weather this was a real website or a purposely badly designed one. i had difficulty believing that it could be this badly designed by accident. However apparently, (if all useless info is removed) seems to be offering leasing deals on cars.
## Review 
it seems that one load up the website bugs for a few seconds, however in place of all animations are small pieces of text e.g. ‘feed is loading’ and then it pops up. Once the music started playing my only goal was to find the pause button however it doesn't seem to exist. 

This site i would say is quite unfamiliar to the user as there are random moving animations, flashing signs. the colour scheme used is an eye sore itself. the website offers car leasing however just finding out how to navigate to a list of cars is a challenge. 

On this site if you accidentally click something unwanted you are either redirected to another website or a huge flashing pop up appears with a few lines or ‘unrelated’ information. if you then aim to go ‘back’ or refresh the entire page reloads itself, the start music commences again and all animations restart. 

serious inconsistency throughout this site. there are many options for the same thing, therefore the user is confused with which one the click perhaps? a lot of pointless clickable links such as a ‘moan’ button. other buttons linking you to tv series watchable on Iplayer. writing over the top of what seems to be the only viable place to click makes the site feel unsafe and tbh i would of left in first 3seconds.

the site lags heavy and when it gets too much it reloads itself. possible an auto-troubleshoot? however it manages to keep up. especially with a fast internet connection and good computer memory.

I feel the question with this site is more ‘where do i go’ since most information and animations of homepage are unrelated and as you scroll down it seems to be blog posts more than actual viable information relevant to car leasing?

If you do end up spending enough time on the site to figure out where the cars are (notice in column on left) you have a list of available car dealers and models of cars to choose from.

Getting around the site efficiently is basically impossible due to having to reload home page before accessing list of cars again.

Pointless Information should be name of website. Small games, twitter feed, links to TV series, on a car leasing website? no thank you.

Documentation of actually leasable cars is quite limited and price table is slightly confusing, especially for inexperienced user. 

Continuing the latter point, pop-ups and glowing text over important information generates headache before you can even see a few pictures of chosen car. 

Content doesn't necessarily need constant updating, apart from price changes and new car models. a Note that website is monitored Monday to Fri 9-6pm must mean often updates. however note could also be out of date. 

Chinese signing upon loading of site is not incredibly enjoyable, also restarts every time you change pages within site. 

Loading time is not monumentally slow however, could be spontaneous if useless information was removed.
