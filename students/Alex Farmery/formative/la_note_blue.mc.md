#La Note Blue

French restaurant website that has an absolutely amazing location and great infrastructure, great food BUT unfortunately crap website. I was amazed at how bad their website is considering their name. Using mentioned heuristics;

Upon clicking on the website, some funky jazz starts to play which, for me is very off-putting as i hate sounds from webpages, especially if the user has more than one tab open.. just unnecessary confusion.

The second shocking aspect of this site is that they dont have it translated into multiple languages. Not even **ENGLISH**. therefore a foreign person trying to book a table… its not happening.

In terms of navigation around the site, going back, forward or cancelling doesn't seem to be a feature as the main nav bar is fixed throughout whatever page of the site you are visiting.

In my opinion there are too many options in the nav bar and this can be confusing especially trying to do it in french. No need for two menu options or a ‘team’ page and a ‘contact’ page, isn't the team being contacted anyways?

Refreshing on the contact form page causes all information to be wiped which, could be avoided.

This site only deals with giving people information about themselves and allowing contact with them therefore recalled information is not really necessary…

Options are fairly straight forward since there are no logos and just linked words. **however** it is in french.
I am confused what type of user this website has been designed for as all of it is harsh on the eye or on the mind (in terms of where do i click to find what i want)
French is a long a complicated language that despite long flowing sentences don't actually say much and therefore more specific quicker information e.g. opening hours, booked or not menu should all be on home page. 

Straight forward…  Address can be put into a GPS. However stopping the french jazz from playing could be a longer task
Bad colour pallet of monotone colours for the entire website. Visually the website is not full screen or responsive at all and hardly has any 3D elements.

Not much content to update apart from potentially the menu and opening hours, however not really a focus when redesigning. 

You can luckily listen to french radio with their badly positioned media player, great!

Loading time is not fast, however reasoning for is unclear, i assume it is due to length of pages as they seem to contain images and text at random times. No order.
